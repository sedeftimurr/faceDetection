# Face Recognition Program

This Jupyter Notebook file contains a simple facial recognition program. The program takes facial photos by asking the user to enter their name, then trains a model, and finally performs facial recognition using the trained model.

## Use

1. **Name Entry:**
    - Run the first code block and enter your name by following the on-screen instructions.
    - The program will take photos of your face.

2. **Model Training:**
    - Move the program to the training phase by running the second code block.
    - When the training is completed, the model file will be created.

3. **Running the Program:**
    - Perform face recognition using the trained model by running the third code block.
    - The program will print the recognition results to the screen.
